I have a folder structure where each folder is named after a client. Inside each client folder are CSV files containing their investment data. Each client invests differentlyâ€”some in crypto, others in real estate, and some in stocks.

Please generate a Chartifact report for each client based on the CSV files and profile.md in their respective folders. The report should include:

1. Visualizations tailored to the type of investment (e.g., crypto trends, real estate ROI, stock performance).
2. A summary of key metrics and insights.
3. An interactive tabulator or calculator that allows the client to simulate different investment scenarios.

The output should be one Chartifact report per client, organized and labeled clearly in a output folder. Let me know if you need a sample folder path or CSV format.
