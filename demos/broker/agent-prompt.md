I have a folder structure where each folder is named after a client. Inside each client folder are CSV files containing their investment data. Each client invests differentlyâ€”some in crypto, others in real estate, and some in stocks.

Please generate a Chartifact report for each client based on the CSV files and profile.md in their respective folders. The report should include:

1. Visualizations tailored to the type of investment (e.g., crypto trends, real estate ROI, stock performance).
2. A summary of key metrics and insights.
3. An interactive tabulator or calculator that allows the client to simulate different investment scenarios.

The Chartifact reports should be based on these examples:
- docs\assets\examples\json\bank-statement.idoc.json
- docs\assets\examples\json\personal-budget.idoc.json
- docs\assets\examples\json\sales-report.idoc.json

The output should be one Chartifact report per client, organized and labeled clearly in a output folder. Let me know if you need a sample folder path or CSV format.
