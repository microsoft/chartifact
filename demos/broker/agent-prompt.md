I have a folder structure where each folder is named after a client. Inside each client folder are CSV files containing their investment data. Each client invests differentlyâ€”some in crypto, others in real estate, and some in stocks.

Please generate a Chartifact report for each client based on the CSV files and profile.md in their respective folders. The report should include:

1. A header that says Alex Quantum Capital on our brand color #44a08d in the background (but do not use this color for charts.)
2. Visualizations tailored to the type of investment (e.g., crypto trends, real estate ROI, stock performance).
3. A summary of key metrics and insights.
4. An editable tabulator that allows the client to simulate different investment scenarios.
5. please put something prominent in the document that says "Generated by AI for demonstration purposes only.". 

## Examples
This is MANDATORY - read and understand each of our standard documents:
- docs/assets/examples/json/bank-statement.idoc.json
- docs/assets/examples/json/personal-budget.idoc.json
- docs/assets/examples/json/sales-report.idoc.json

## Client Isolation
Ensure that you do not mix client data, work with one client folder at a time. 

## Output
The output should be one Chartifact report per client, organized and labeled clearly in a output folder.

## Schema
Ensure your document json adheres to the TypeScript declarations: docs/schema/idoc_v1.d.ts

## Validation
Check each json file for validation errors
example:
```sh
#from the root
node packages/compiler/test/validate.mjs docs/assets/examples/json/movie-picker.idoc.json
```
