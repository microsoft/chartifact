# MCP Component Research - Quick Summary

**Research Date:** October 2025 (Revised after feedback)  
**Full Report:** [mcp-component-analysis.md](./mcp-component-analysis.md)

## Question

Should Chartifact implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) component for creating and editing interactive documents?

## Answer

**YES - Implement a lightweight transactional builder with MCP wrapper (1-2 days effort).**

## Revised Analysis

Initial recommendation was "No" based on overestimated complexity (5-7 weeks). After feedback, revised to lightweight approach:

### Key Insights

1. **Time estimate was way off**: 1-2 days for simple builder + MCP wrapper, not 5-7 weeks
2. **Multi-turn conversations benefit**: Token accumulation across many editing turns makes transactional operations valuable
3. **LLMs miss schema details**: Structured operations help prevent common mistakes
4. **Editor completion easier with builder**: Builder provides foundation for editor, not vice versa

## Key Findings

### 1. Multi-Turn Token Accumulation Matters
- Single document: 741 lines (~5,000 tokens)
- 20 editing turns: 100,000+ tokens (exhausts context)
- Transactional operations: Send only changes, not full document each time

### 2. Schema Clarity vs. Practice
- Schema is clear in theory
- LLMs can miss details in practice
- Structured builder prevents violations
- Sensible defaults help starting point

### 3. Lightweight Implementation
- **Effort:** 1-2 days, not 5-7 weeks
- **Code:** 350-600 lines, not 2,500-4,000
- **Maintenance:** Minimal - maps to schema

### 4. Editor Foundation
- Builder simplifies editor completion
- Ready-made operations (add, delete, update)
- Shared validation logic
- Easier undo/redo implementation

## Benefits vs. Costs

### Benefits (Revised)

| Benefit | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Token efficiency | High | Multi-turn conversations stay in context |
| Schema validation | High | Structured operations prevent mistakes |
| Editor foundation | High | Builder simplifies editor completion |
| Sensible defaults | High | Start with working document, not blank |
| MCP tool access | Medium | Standardized protocol for external tools |

### Costs (Revised)

| Cost | Effort | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Transactional builder | 1 day | Core operations, validation |
| MCP wrapper | 0.5 day | Thin shim over builder |
| File integration | 0.5 day | Load/save operations |
| **Total** | **1-2 days** | Focused development |

**Verdict: Benefits outweigh costs** with lightweight approach.

## Recommendation

### Implement Lightweight Transactional Builder + MCP Wrapper

**Why the change from original "No"?**

1. **Complexity overestimated**: 1-2 days, not 5-7 weeks
2. **Multi-turn conversations**: Token accumulation is real issue
3. **LLMs miss schema**: Structured operations help in practice
4. **Editor needs foundation**: Builder makes editor easier to complete

### Implementation Plan

**Day 1: Transactional Builder**
- Create immutable document builder class
- Core operations: create, addGroup, addElement, delete*
- Type-safe API with validation
- Sensible defaults included

**Day 1-2: MCP Wrapper**
- Thin shim exposing builder via MCP protocol
- Tool definitions with JSON schemas
- Simple state management

**Day 2: File Integration**
- Load/save .idoc.json files
- Basic error handling

**Next: Refactor Editor**
- Use builder as foundation
- Simpler implementation
- Ready-made operations

## Conclusion

**Revised recommendation: YES, implement lightweight version.**

Original analysis overestimated complexity and underestimated benefits:
- **Complexity**: 1-2 days, not 5-7 weeks
- **Multi-turn value**: Token efficiency matters
- **Practical LLM behavior**: Structured operations help
- **Editor synergy**: Builder provides foundation

**Next step:** Implement simple transactional builder with MCP wrapper.
