# MCP Component Research - Quick Summary

**Research Date:** October 2025  
**Full Report:** [mcp-component-analysis.md](./mcp-component-analysis.md)

## Question

Should Chartifact implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) component for creating and editing interactive documents?

## Answer

**NO - Do not implement MCP component at this time.**

## Key Findings

### 1. Documents Fit Entirely in LLM Context
- Largest example document: 741 lines (~5,000 tokens)
- Modern LLMs have 100K+ token context windows
- No need for partial document access via MCP

### 2. JSON Format is Already LLM-Friendly
- Well-structured, predictable schema
- LLMs can read, understand, and edit directly
- No abstraction layer needed

### 3. Current Editor is Incomplete
- Editor sends full documents (not deltas as stated in problem)
- No transaction system exists yet
- Should complete basic editor before adding MCP

### 4. Implementation Cost is High
- **Estimated effort:** 5-7 weeks development
- **Code size:** 2,500-4,000 lines + tests + docs
- **Maintenance:** Ongoing as schema evolves

### 5. Benefits are Marginal
- ❌ Atomic operations: Nice but unnecessary for single-user editing
- ❌ Partial access: Documents fit in context
- ❌ Transactions: Not a current requirement
- ❌ Conflict resolution: No collaborative editing yet
- ❌ External tools: None exist that need integration

## Use Case Comparison

| Task | Without MCP | With MCP | Winner |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Create document | 1 step (generate JSON) | 10+ tool calls | Without MCP |
| Edit document | Read + edit + write | Read + multiple calls | Without MCP |
| Multi-step edit | Apply all changes at once | Multiple round-trips | Without MCP |
| Collaborative edit | Last write wins | Conflict detection | With MCP* |

\* Not a current requirement

## Recommendation

### Instead of MCP, Do This:

1. **Document JSON editing patterns** - Guide LLMs on how to edit documents effectively
2. **Complete the editor** - Finish basic functionality first
3. **Improve examples** - Add more examples showing document patterns
4. **Wait for pain points** - Implement MCP only if real needs emerge

### When to Reconsider MCP

Implement MCP if:
- ✅ Documents regularly exceed 50K tokens (unlikely)
- ✅ Users need collaborative editing (possible future)
- ✅ 3+ external tools need document manipulation (unlikely)
- ✅ Editor implements transaction system (natural evolution)

## Phased Approach

**Phase 1 (Now):** Direct JSON editing ✅ Working well

**Phase 2 (If needed):** Create lightweight transaction library
- Shared between editor and tools
- No MCP protocol yet
- ~200-300 lines of code

**Phase 3 (If needed):** Wrap transaction library in MCP
- Only if external tools need integration
- Or collaborative editing becomes priority

## Conclusion

**Costs outweigh benefits.** The JSON format is sufficient for LLM-based document creation and editing. MCP would add unnecessary complexity (2,500-4,000 lines) before core features are complete. Focus should remain on finishing the editor and improving documentation.

MCP can be added later if genuine needs emerge.
