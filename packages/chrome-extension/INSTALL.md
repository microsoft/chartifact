# Installing the Chartifact Chrome Extension

This guide helps you install and test the Chartifact Chrome extension for viewing Interactive Document files.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Extension

From the repository root:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run build --workspace=@microsoft/chartifact-chrome-extension
```

### 2. Load in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the folder: `packages/chrome-extension/dist`
5. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### 3. Test the Extension

**Option A: Use the test page**
1. Open `packages/chrome-extension/test.html` in Chrome
2. Click on one of the test file links
3. Look for the "ðŸ“Š View as Interactive Document" button

**Option B: Test with local files**
1. Download any `.idoc.json` or `.idoc.md` file
2. Open it in Chrome (drag and drop into browser)
3. The extension should detect it and show the view button

### 4. Using the Extension

- **Automatic Detection**: The extension automatically detects `.idoc.md` and `.idoc.json` files
- **View Button**: Look for the floating "ðŸ“Š View as Interactive Document" button in the top-right
- **Extension Popup**: Click the extension icon to see status and controls
- **Secure Rendering**: All content is rendered in a sandboxed iframe for security

## Example Files to Test

You can test with these example files in the repository:
- `packages/examples/json/seattle-weather/6.idoc.json`
- `packages/chrome-extension/test.idoc.json` (simple test file)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not detecting files
- Ensure the file has `.idoc.md` or `.idoc.json` extension
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try refreshing the page

### View button not appearing
- Make sure you're viewing an actual idoc file (not just a page that links to one)
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify the extension has proper permissions

### Viewer not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure the chartifact libraries are properly loaded
- Verify the file content is valid Interactive Document format

### Permission issues
- The extension needs `activeTab` permission to function
- For local files, you may need to enable "Allow access to file URLs" in the extension details

## For Developers

### Building from Source
```bash
cd packages/chrome-extension
npm run build        # Build the extension
npm run package      # Create distributable ZIP
npm run dev          # Watch mode for development
```
